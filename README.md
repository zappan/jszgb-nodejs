# JavaScript Zagreb Meetups - NodeJs Apps Demos

This repository contains code I have used as demos for server-side
JavaScript at [JavaScript Zagreb](http://jszgb.com) meetups.

Each meetup final code is tagged as major release (1.0.0, 2.0.0, etc.),
so checkout the respective tag to get the particular meetup code.

## Topics covered:

* Meetup #2: Express apps: Routing, Controllers, HTML Views / JSON-API
* Meetup #1: Hello Node.js
